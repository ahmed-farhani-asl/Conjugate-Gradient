# Conjugate Gradient Method for Solving Linear Systems

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the **Conjugate Gradient (CG) algorithm** for solving systems of linear equations of the form **Ax = b**. The program reads the coefficient matrix `A` and the constant vector `b` from a file named `Ax=b.txt` and computes the solution vector `x` using the CG method.

## Introduction

The Conjugate Gradient method is an iterative algorithm used to solve systems of linear equations, particularly for large, sparse, and symmetric positive-definite matrices. This implementation uses a **10th-order Runge-Kutta integration** for high precision and includes functions for matrix inversion, determinant calculation, and permutation generation.

---

## Features

- **Matrix Inversion**: Computes the inverse of the coefficient matrix `A`.
- **Determinant Calculation**: Calculates the determinant of `A` using permutations and the Levi-Civita symbol.
- **Conjugate Gradient Algorithm**: Solves the system `Ax = b` iteratively until convergence.

## Usage

1. **Compile and run the code**:
```bash
g++ -o conjugate_gradient conjugate_gradient.cpp -std=c++11 -O3
```
```sh
./conjugate_gradient
```

## Input Format

The input file Ax=b.txt should contain the coefficient matrix A and the constant vector b in the following format:
```sh
a11 a12 a13 ... a1n b1
a21 a22 a23 ... a2n b2
...
an1 an2 an3 ... ann bn
```
